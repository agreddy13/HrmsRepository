# HrmsRepository
I used this  domain (https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/index.php/auth/login)

Created test cases for the following pages,
	Login
	User Home
	Add Employee under PIM module

Input taken from excel sheet for each test case and result ("Pass" if the test case passed) updated under testRunStatus column.  Used Apache POI to read and write excel files. All test data files can find under TestData folder.
TestConfig.xls has all test case information.

Required properties provided config.properties

Execution options:
	Using Java Application (TestNGCreator.java)
	Using TestNG Suite (HrmsTestSuite.xml)

I am looking into SPOCK and GEB.  If possible, I will try to create few test cases and upload to repository.
Please review and let me know. I would like to know if I have to improve on something..Even if I don't qualify for Medtronix.
